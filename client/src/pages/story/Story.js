Flaunting traditional Pakistani motifs and patterning, our collections feature a wide range of unique one-of-a-kind home textiles tediously sewn and embroidered by hand. Our wide variety of home textile goods are exquisitely handcrafted works of art personally produced by impoverished women from the most destitute regions of Pakistan. Each piece is unique and highlights the story of the artisan who created it."

Moreover, Pakistan has the lowest rate of female entrepreneurship in the world, with only 1% of female entrepreneurs compared to 21% of male entrepreneurs. There are several structural, institutional, and socio-cultural reasons behind these statistical differences. We aim to lessen this gap and help liberate and emancipate these skilled Pakistani seamstresses who have long suffered from lack of opportunity, a scarcity of technology and a slew of other burdens, barriers and impediments."
